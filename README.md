Feeling a bit nostalgic, I decided to create this PONG GAME.

**OVERVIEW**

The game starts with a basic menu where you can choose from three different levels: "EASY LEVEL," "NORMAL LEVEL," and "GOAT LEVEL."

The rules are straightforward:

Score a goal before the computer does.
Use the mouse to move the paddle on the right side of the screen up and down to protect your goal.
Try to hit the ball from different points on the paddle to give it different angles.
And last but not least, enjoy!

P.S. GOAT LEVEL is practically impossible :)
