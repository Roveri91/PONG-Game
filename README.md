# PONG-Game
Feeling a little bit nostalgic i decide to make this PONG GAME

The game starts with a basic menu where you can choose from three different level:
"EASY LEVEL" "NORMAL LEVEL"  & "GOAT LEVEL"

Rules are very simple.

-Score a GOAL before the COM does it.
-Using the mouse move the paddle on the right side of the screen up and down and protect your goal.
-try to hit the ball with different from different point of the paddle to give different angle at the ball.
-LAST but not LEAST enjoy.

p.s. GOAT LEVEL is impossible :)
